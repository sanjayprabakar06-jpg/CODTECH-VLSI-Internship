Tasks Completed:

 1. BASIC ALU DESIGN
- Designed an 8-bit ALU using Verilog HDL
- Verified with testbench

 2. SYNCHRONOUS RAM
- 16x8 Synchronous RAM module
- Read/Write verified with simulation

 3. DIGITAL FIR FILTER
- 4-tap FIR Filter using Verilog
- Verified filtered output

 4. 4-STAGE PIPELINED PROCESSOR
- Fetch, Decode, Execute, Write Back stages
- Verified with simple instructions

 Tools Used:
- Verilog HDL
- Icarus Verilog (online)
- GitHub

 Conclusion:
All tasks implemented and verified through simulation.
